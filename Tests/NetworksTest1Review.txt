20 multiple choice/short answer

Full class time will be used for the Test

  OSI Network Model
    Physical Layer
      How do 1s and 0s get around?
    Data Link Layer
      How do you check quality of transmitted
  Physical
    A single transition from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1 has infinite frequencies to be exactly encoded/recorded
      A square wave is the sum of the infinite odd harmonics
    Synchronization Bits to make electronics
    Perform Correctly
    AM and FM can be used with
      light
      radio
      sound
    AM
      Automatic Gain Control
      Amplitude Modulation
    FM
      Frequency Modulation
      Change the spacing of Pulses
    Framing - error checking
      Start/Stop bits for RS232
      56 10101010x7 of Ethernet
      Stop bits
      Interpacket Gap
  Data Link Layer
    Parity
      1 bit parity that is part of RS232
      2d Parity for fixing 1 bit errors
    Checksum
    CRC
  Modification to increase performance
    GCR code
    RLL encoding
      Limited the number of 1s or 0s in a row.
  Concepts go across more than networks
    Disk Drives
    Compact Disks
    Compressions
  RS-232
    TTL-RS-232
      RS-232 as a 5V standard signals
    6-8 bit transmittion
    Baud has to be agreed upon.
    Asynchronous
      no explicit clock signal.
    Stop and Start Bit
    parity
    8N1 -  8 data bits no parity 1 stop bit.
    Transmit slower to using cruddier signals/wiring
    Still around
      Virtualised over USB
      Bluetooth

SPI
  Asynchronous
  MOSI, Miso, CLK, !CS
  no address. you use Chip/Slave Select
  SD Cards
  Memory Devices
  Limited by slowest device in link ( and of course wiring)
I2C
  Synchronous
  No parity
  SDA, SCL, Data and Clock
  Is address
  Sensor
    Mouse Pad, Accelerometer
    Wii-Nunchuck
Ardiuno, R-Pi all have both SPI and I2C interfaces
PC does but not exposed to the outside Wurld
