25 multiple choice
first test is good study guide
#Test 1 Review
1. A simple transition from zero to one includes how many frequencies?
  - An infinite number
2. I2C is what kind of communication?
  - Synchronous
3. A protocol transmits 1 byte at a time through a serial connection at 9600 bits
 per second with 1 start, 1 stop, and no parity bit. What is the minimum time it
 will take to transmit 72000 bytes or octets?
  - 75s - remember you are doing 9600 BITS not bytes so it is going to be really slow.
4. What is the lowest layer of the OSI 7-layer network diagram?
  - Physical
5. RS232 or 'Serial' port use a common ground and...
  - a transmit and a recieve wire.
6. what is the odd-parity of 0110?
  - 1
7. Bits or bytes of information to verify that both sides of a communication have the same data at the end of the reception are named?
  - CRC or Checksum
8. Bits or Bytes of data to synchronize the timing on both sides of a communication channel are usually named?
  - Framing
9. What is the second lowest layer of the OSI 7-layer Network?
  - Data Link
10. SPI uses a common ground and
  - A master in slave out, a master out slave in, a clock and a slave select.
11. RS-232 (Serial Ports) are
  - Still used even virtualized today
12. CRC stands for
  - cyclic redundancy check
13. If data is being transmitted at 9600 baud what is probably true about the wiring and hardware on both sides of the communication?
  - The wire and hardware can be poor quality.
14. A transmission approach that does not have a separate clock line is said to be?
  - asynchronous
15. FM communication
  - Changes frequency of the transmitted signal
16. SPI (Serial Peripheral interface) bus is an example of which type of communication?
  - Synchronous
17. AM communication
  - Changes volume of the transmitted signal
18. A simple on/off signal on a wire that a fixed frequency contains
  - infinite harmonics
19. I2C uses a common ground
  - a data and a clock wire
20. High speed data transmission
  - better quality wire/fiber optics and more precisely timed equipment
21. A transmission approach that does have a separate clock line is said to be
  - synchronous
22. Preamble bits or bytes are used to
  - synchronize timing and stabilize the AGC
23. SMTP stands for
  - A Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
24. Bits or bytes of nothing after data at the end of transmission are named?
  - Stop or Gap
25. To convert bps to Bps a quick rule is to
  - divide by 10 - you have to cover the start and stop bit which makes 10 total bits.
26. BAUD rate and bps would be different if
  - at any moment more than a single 1 or 0 is transmitted.

  OSI network model
  Ethernet
    Port
      0-1023 root user ports
        smtp
          - internet standard for electronic email
          Uses TCP port 25
            often submit the outgoing emails to a mail server on port 587 or 465
        http
          Typically port 80
          occasionally 8080
        https
          uses port 443
          encrypted version of http
        ssh
          uses TCP port 22
        telnet
          uses tcp port 23
      1024-65535 free for all
    UDP vs TCP
      UDP has not Synchronization or acknowledgment
        - User Datagram Protocol
        sends data randomly so may come in different order but is really fast.
        Datagram
      TCP packets arrive in order and are resent if needed
        - Transmission Control Protocol
        provides reliable, ordered, and erro-checked delivery in a stream of octets
          - Checksum is used just like in udp
        stream
    star network configuration
      - when all computers or things that connect to the internet where every host is connected to a central hub.
      - the one central hub acts s a conduit to transmit messages.
    Ping
      - uses ICMP specifically ICMP echo request and ICMP echo reply packets there i sno port associated with
      ICMP. Ports are associated with two IP transport layer protocols, TCP and UDP. ICMP packets are identified
      by the 'protocol' field in the IP datagram
      Port?
    IPv4
      when it was born 4 octets for address
        - 32-bit integer value that is dot-decimal notation in 4x8 byte pattern
      192.168.1.23
    IPv6
      Where we want to go but movement is slow
      more secure
    Coding
      You can choose any programming language you want
      Bind
        cant be bound again
        executable taking a port number's ownership
      Listen
        When server is waiting on stream connections
      Connect
        client making a stream connection
      Services
        DNS-Domain Name Service
          Human names for a server to the number
        DHCP Dynamic Host configuration Protocol
          assigns ip addresses for certain machines on the network
          Not used for Static IP addresses
          Hosts
        FW-Firewall
          Blocks incoming traffic that does not have an outbound request
        Switch
          Internet Protocol Packet Routing
        NAT Network Address Translation
          allows local addresses to be different than wide area network (WAN, world) addresses
        Option ? probably not on test
          SMB SaMBa server Message Block
            Network attached storage
          SSH Secure shell
            Secure version of telnet
            Command console to another machine
        "Client"
          As many as you want!
        "Server"
          One per port per machine
